# Simple Contributor Code of Conduct

## Version 0.9.0

We expect participants to:

- **Be respectful and considerate**: Treat others with courtesy and respect. Disagreements should be handled professionally.

- **Provide constructive feedback**: Offer feedback that is helpful and aimed at improving the project.

- **Promote a collaborative environment**: Engage in discussions and decisions in a way that fosters teamwork.

- **Acknowledge mistakes**: Recognize errors, apologize when necessary, and learn from the experience.

- **Keep discussions on topic**: We welcome all wings - left, right, or even chicken ones (vegan or meat). ;) People having different opinions about things in real life is healthy and expected. However, keep off-topic discussions away from the project spaces.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Repeated harassment, slurs, threats, or targeted degradation.

- Sustained disruption of discussions (spam, flooding, derailing).

- Personal attacks.

- The publication of private information without consent.

## Interpretation

We interpret this Code of Conduct charitably. Honest mistakes, miscommunication, and isolated incidents of frustration are addressed through conversation, not punishment.
Enforcement escalates only for repeated or egregious violations. Technical disagreements, even heated ones, are not Code of Conduct matters unless they cross into personal attacks.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at <janderssonse@proton.me>.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly.
The project team reserves the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Repeatedly filing false or bad-faith reports is itself a violation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces (repositories, issue trackers, chat channels).

In exceptional cases, the project may decline contributions from individuals convicted of serious violent crimes (e.g., murder, sexual assault). This is about safety, not policing opinions - we don't care what you think, we care what you do.
